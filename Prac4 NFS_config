Setting up a Network File System

Configuring the Server Machine

Step 1: Installing NFS Server 
  sudo apt-get -y install nfs-kernel-server
  
Step 2: Make a new directory to be shared over the network
  mkdir dir_name
  
Step 3: Configure the exports config file
  sudo nano /etc/exports

Step 4: Append the following line, in case of a single client (here we use 127.0.0.1 as client IP)
  dir_path clientIP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
 
Step 5: Time to export the file system onto the network
  sudo exportfs -a

Step 6: For the configurations to work, restart the service
  sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
  
Step 7: Configure ufw to accept requests to the shared folder
  sudo ufw allow from clientIP to any port nfs
  
Step 8: Check the status 
  sudo ufw status
  
Configuring the Client Machine

Step 1: Install NFS Common
  sudo apt-get install nfs-common
  
Step 2: Create a mount point for the NFS hostâ€™s shared folder
  sudo mkdir clien_dir
  
Step 3: Mount the shared directory on the client (here since we're testing it on the local machine we use serverIP as: 127.0.0.1)
  sudo mount serverIP:/server_shared_folder client_shared_folder_path

Testing the connection:

Step 1: Add some file to the server side shared folder

Step 2: Change directory to the client directory path and see if the file is visible there
  cd client_shared_dir_path
