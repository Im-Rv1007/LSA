Installing and configuring Samba server for file sharing.

1. Let's first update apt
  sudo apt update

2. Install samba now
  sudo apt install samba

3. We're going to make a directory which Samba can share (here: sambashare)
  mkdir <path>/sambashare/

4. Editing the config file at /etc/samba/smb.conf, to let samba know of the folder. (using nano here)
  sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
  
5. Insert the following at the end of the config file and then hit Ctrl + O and Ctrl + X
  [sambashare]
    comment = Samba on Ubuntu
    path = /home/username/sambashare
    read only = no
    browsable = yes
    
6. Restarting the samba service
  sudo service smbd restart
 
7. Allowing ufw to allow requests
  sudo ufw allow samba
  
8. Now we'll set up a samba password for the user
  sudo smbpasswd -a username
  
9. For Windows type the below in the File Explorer (ip address is of the samba server)
  \\ip-address\sambashare
                      OR
    For your local machine, to test
   smb://ip-address/sambashare
